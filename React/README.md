# React


## Contrast and Compare
Other front-end frameworks and libraries exist. What are some examples of these, and how does React compare/contrast with those?

  - React is a library not a framework

## jQuery
#### Compare
  - is a library like React, not a framework
  - wraps up many common vanilla JavaScript functions and initially gained popularity because it is guaranteed to behave identically on any brower

#### Contrast
  - components rendered by React are a pure function of the React state, i.e. props and component state.
  - jQuery primarily allows you to directly manipulate the DOM, meaning that it is up to the programmer to keep the DOM in sync with the internal state of the app


## Vue.js
#### Compare
  - Vue is another front end library.
  - like React it uses a virtual DOM and composable components
#### Contrast
  - Vue's virtual DOM is lighter wiehgt than React
  - Vue is significantly faster, however Vue's developer community is much smaller than React's
  - so smaller ecosystem of libraries plugins and support

## Angular
Initially released in 2009 and is maintained by Google and a community of developers.
Part of the MEAN stack:
  - MongoDB database
  - Express.js server
  - Angular.js
  - Node.js

#### Contrast
  - Angular is a framework not a library like React and implements a MVVVM framework ( Model-View-ViewModel)
  - Perhaps more functionality out of the box than React

## Ember
Ember is a framework and not just a library
 - hard to customize being a framework
 - doesn't have a large core team so development is slow

## React Native
React Native allows developers to write React apps in JavaScript and run them on mobile devices. Released by Facebook and is also used by many companies like AirBnB and Instagram.
