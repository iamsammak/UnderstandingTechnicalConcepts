# Responsive Web Design

## Add viewport meta tag
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1" />
```

## Media Queries
```css
@media (max-width: 414px) {
  /* css code inside here */
}
```

Uses the '@media' rule which only executes a block of CSS code if set conditions are true

Great way of thinking is Mobile First. Designing for mobile and scaling your website to adapt to desktop. Easier to grasp this way.
