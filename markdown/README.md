#### Images
Old Format:
```
![image]
[image]: ./images/old_image.png
```
Correct Format:
```
![image](image url here)
```

After testing, I found that the old format works if you add an extra line(enter) between the bracket refence and the image link reference
```
![image]

[image]: ./images/old_image.png
```
