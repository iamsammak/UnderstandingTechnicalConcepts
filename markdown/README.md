#### Images
Old Format:
```
![image]
[image]: ./images/old_image.png
```
Correct Format:
```
![image](image url here)
```

After testing, I found that the old format works if you add at least an extra line between the bracket reference and the image link reference it still works
```
![image]

[image]: ./images/old_image.png
```
