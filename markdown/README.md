#### Images
Old Format:
```
![image]
[image]: ./images/old_image.png
```
Correct Format:
```
![image](image url here)
```

After testing, I found that the old format works if you add at least an extra line between the bracket reference and the image link reference it still works
```
![image]

[image]: ./images/old_image.png
```

####Emphasis

```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
